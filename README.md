# Mission-to-Mars

This project aims to create a website application using Flask to scrape data from many external sites to a single place. The application accepts user input to scrape news stories and featured images, as well as statistics about both Mars and Earth and full hemispheric photographs of the planet. The site leverages Flask to run the application, Splinter through Python to automate browser use for data scraping, Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, MongoDB to store, update, and recall scraped data, and Bootstrap plus HTML to format the visual presentation of the site. This project is an excellent template for future site construction, and can be further enhanced using Javascript and CSS elements.
